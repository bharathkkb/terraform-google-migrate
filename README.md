# CFT Migrate for Compute Engine (Migrate for Compute Engine)

Using Cloud Foundation Toolkit (CFT) you can quickly deploy a landing zone for your [Migrate for Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/) migration to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) projects, save time and avoid misconfiguration issues.


## Migrate for Compute Engine Prerequisites


### Migration Qualification

Before proceeding with migration, you should already know:

1.  How many approximately VMs will be migrated
2.  What is migration target VMs source - Azure, AWS or on-prem
3.  How many GCP projects you will need for migrated VMs
4.  Do you have/plan on-prem or other cloud connection to GCP via [VPN](https://cloud.google.com/vpn/docs/concepts/overview) / [Interconnect](https://cloud.google.com/hybrid-connectivity/)
5.  Is there any network load balancing involved
6.  How much storage will be needed in GCP


### Deployment Type

There are two types of deployment that you can choose from using CFT for Migrate for Compute Engine:

**Single-project** deployment where Migrate for Compute Engine frontend, Cloud Extension and migrated VMs hosted under the same GCP project:

**Multi-project** deployment, environment is split into four or more different GCP projects to host separated shared VPC, Migrate for Compute Engine frontend and migrated VMs:

**Example** of high level architecture for a multi project landing zone:

### Technical Prerequisites

CFT for Migrate for Compute Engine is build on top of [Google Cloud Project Factory Terraform Module](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-project-factory) and if additional customization needed please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-project-factory/blob/master/README.md).

You will create the following via CFT and Terraform:

1.  GCP project to host Migrate for Compute Engine Manager and Cloud Extensions (CE)
1.  GCP VPC Project (if shared VPC will be used)
1.  VPC with subnets
1.  [Firewall rules](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/docs/4.5/concepts/planning-a-migration/network-access-requirements) for Migrate for Compute Engine
1.  GCP Network Tags for Migrate for Compute Engine
1.  Destination Projects
1.  GCP [roles and service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/docs/4.5/how-to/configuring-gcp/configuring-gcp-manually) for Migrate for Compute Engine
1.  VPN (Optional)


Finally [deploying](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/docs/4.5/how-to/configure-manager/configuring-on-gcp) Migrate for Compute Engine Manager via GCP [Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/click-to-deploy-images/velostrata?_ga=2.230596124.-1830265044.1554384916&_gac=1.75634663.1564563946.CL6bne_m3uMCFYYkGwodLkkPoQ).


## Getting Started


#### Configuring Migrate for Compute Engine Landing Zone with CFT


### Tools

**Install Cloud SDK** \
The Google Cloud SDK is used to interact with your GCP resources. [Installation instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads) for

multiple platforms are available online.

**Install Terraform** \
Terraform is used to automate the manipulation of cloud infrastructure. Its [installation instructions](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html) are also available online.

**Authenticate gcloud** \
Prior to running this, ensure you have authenticated your gcloud client by running the following command:



```
gcloud auth application-default login
```



### Deployment

Download the repository:


```
git clone https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-migrate.git
```


File structure

The project has the following folders and files:


```

/: root folder
/examples: Examples for doing single and multi project deployments
/modules: Modules for core, single and multi projects
/helpers: Optional helper scripts for ease of use
/main.tf: TODO
/variables.tf:TODO
/output.tf: TODO
/readme.md: this file

```
**Single project deployment:**

We will start with deploying our **single** project:


```
cd examples/single_deployment
```


Provide this variables in terraform.tfvars:


```
organization_id = "GCP ORGANIZATION ID"
billing_account = "GCP BILLING ID"
credentials_path = "SA KEY USED TO PROVISION RESOURCES"
subnet_01_ip = "GCP VPC SUBNET IP"
subnet_02_ip = "GCP VPC SUBNET IP"
subnet_03_ip = "GCP VPC SUBNET IP"
secondary_s01_range = "SECONDARY IP VPC SUBNET RANGE"
secondary_s02_range = "SECONDARY IP VPC SUBNET RANGE"
secondary_s03_range = "SECONDARY IP VPC SUBNET RANGE"
subnet_01_region = "GCP VPC REGION"
subnet_02_region = "GCP VPC REGION"
subnet_03_region = "GCP VPC REGION"
local_subnet_01_ip = "ON-PREM/OTHER CLOUD SUBNET"
```


Initialize, plan and deploy:


```
terraform init
tf plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
tf apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
```
The service accounts and project names required for completing the deployment will be generated as terraform output.

Once complete continue with [deploying](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/docs/4.5/how-to/configure-manager/configuring-on-gcp) Migrate for Compute Engine Manager via GCP [Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/click-to-deploy-images/velostrata?_ga=2.230596124.-1830265044.1554384916&_gac=1.75634663.1564563946.CL6bne_m3uMCFYYkGwodLkkPoQ) and Migrate for Compute Engine [backend](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/docs/4.5/how-to/configure-manager/configuring-vms-vm) or [prerequisites](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/docs/4.5/how-to/migrate-aws-to-gcp/overview) for AWS if migrating from AWS, and [prerequisites](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine/docs/4.5/how-to/migrate-azure-to-gcp/azure-prerequisites) for Microsoft.


**Multi project deployment:**


```
cd ..
cd examples/multi_deployment
```


Provide this variables in terraform.tfvars:


```
organization_id = "GCP ORGANIZATION ID"
billing_account = "GCP BILLING ID"
credentials_path = "SA KEY USED TO PROVISION RESOURCES"
subnet_01_ip = "GCP VPC SUBNET IP"
subnet_02_ip = "GCP VPC SUBNET IP"
subnet_03_ip = "GCP VPC SUBNET IP"
secondary_s01_range = "SECONDARY IP VPC SUBNET RANGE"
secondary_s02_range = "SECONDARY IP VPC SUBNET RANGE"
secondary_s03_range = "SECONDARY IP VPC SUBNET RANGE"

subnet_02_region = "GCP VPC REGION"
subnet_03_region = "GCP VPC REGION"
local_subnet_01_ip = "ON-PREM/OTHER CLOUD SUBNET"
```

The service accounts and project names required for completing the deployment will be generated as terraform output.
